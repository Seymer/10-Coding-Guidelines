# 10-Coding-Guidelines

 1. Write short units of code: limit the length of methods and constructors
 2. Write simple units of code: limit the number of branch points per method
 3. Write code once, rather than risk copying buggy code
 4. Keep unit interfaces small by extracting parameters into objects
 5. Separate concerns to avoid building large classes
 6. Couple architecture components loosely
 7. Balance the number and size of top-level components in your code
 8. Keep your codebase as small as possible
 9. Automate tests for your codebase
10. Write clean code, avoiding "code smells" that indicate deeper problems
